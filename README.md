## A project to vet out a basic e-commerce web platform produced by knightprogrmming.
This back end is to make a true headless ecommerce experince that is robust and fast with an extensive api for updating and even passing calls to other backends so that you can plug your commerce site into any system.



## Product Outline
The default product system that comes out of the box. We want to be able to allow users to replace this with a different product system at some point.
